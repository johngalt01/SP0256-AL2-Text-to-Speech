This is a Text to Speech converter for the SP0256-AL2 speech chip.
It is very Alpha and I'm sure contains bugs and mistakes.


PARSER.COM is the main program you run and enter either a word or a line of text to convert.
the converted phonics are saved in TEXTTEMP.TXT then output through READSAY.COM

READSAY.COM Will read converted phonics text inside the TEXTTEMP.TXT file

TEXTTEMP.TXT is a temp file that is erased and recreated when PARSER.COM is run.

you can copy TEXTTEMP.TXT to another file and save the contents which you can use inside of 
your own program where you want to use speech or you can replay them through READSAY.COM in the future.
by copying the file name back to TEXTTEMP.TXT

the rest of the included files in the LIBRARY Archive are needed to support PARSER. 
BRUN is needed to run all the programs.
